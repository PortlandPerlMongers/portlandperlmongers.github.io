<h2>Why & How:</h2>
PDX.pm is a support and educational group that meets to discuss the perl
language and its ecosystem. We would love to have you join us. If there
is anything that you feel is missing from this page it is quite likely
on our <a
  href='https://github.com/PortlandPerlMongers/portlandperlmongers.github.io/wiki'>wiki</a>.

<p>
We are an all volunteer group, if you would like to help with our
meetings in any way please get a hold of us.
