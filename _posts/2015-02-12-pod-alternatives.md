title: Feb 12, 2015 - Documenting Perl and POD Alternatives
layout: article
category: meetings
excerpt: Stephan and Anthony will be discussing alternatives to documenting with POD
---

----

Stefan and Anthony will be discussing some new alternatives to POD that they've
both been working on. Stefan has been working on parsing [Markdown][markdown]
formatted documentation out of Perl source. Anthony has been working on an
extension to the [Sphinx documentation engine][sphinx] to support writing
[rST][rst] formatted documentation in Perl source. Both attempts are in their
infancy, so be sure to give feedback and suggestions.

If anyone else would like to join in, or if someone wants to defend lowly ol’
POD, you’re welcome to join in as well.

[sphinx]: http://sphinx-doc.org
[rst]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

**
Join us at the [Portland Incubator Experiment (PIE) office][piepdx],
located at 12th and NW Davis.
PIE is next to the streetcar, walking distance from the MAX,
and Brewery Parking Garage is across the street if you are driving.
