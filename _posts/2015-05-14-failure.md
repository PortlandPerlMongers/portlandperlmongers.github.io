excerpt: VM Brasseur will discuss how to avoid the many reasons projects fail, and how to use failure to your advantage.

Perl Monger [VM Brasseur][vmbrasseur] will be discussing project failure this month.

Projects fail in droves. Up to 90% of new businesses fail within 10 years.
Screws fall out all the time; the world is an imperfect place.

Just because it happens doesn’t mean we can’t do our best to prevent it or—at
the very least—to minimize the damage when it does. As a matter of fact,
embracing failure can be one of the best things you do for your project. Failure
is a vital part of evolution. By learning to love failure we learn how to take
the next step forward. Ignoring or punishing failure leads to stagnation and
wasted potential.

During this session she'll cover:

 * The most common causes for failure
 * Suggestions for how to avoid failing
 * How to use failure to your advantage
